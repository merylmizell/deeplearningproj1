Sustainable Investment Recommendation System (Finance & Environmental)

Problem Definition:
- This project aims to recommend environmentally sustainable companies for investment by analyzing stock price data and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) scores. The goal is to determine if companies with high ESG scores exhibit more stable stock price growth.

Data:
- Stock prices and ESG scores from Yahoo Finance API or the Sustainable Stock Exchange Initiative.
Key columns: Stock price, ESG scores (environmental, social, governance), industry.

Hypotheses:
- Companies with high ESG scores show stable stock price growth over time.
- A deep learning model can predict future stock performance using ESG and historical stock data.
- Sustainable companies provide higher long-term financial returns.
Deep Learning Algorithms:
- Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction from stock data and ESG scores.

Practical Outcome:
- A recommendation system to suggest sustainable companies for investment based on their ESG performance.
